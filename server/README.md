# Still Life Backend
By Eileen Chang

### Description
This is a photo archival project that provides users with randomly generated nouns that are used as photo or drawing prompts. All of the photos compiled from multiple contributors will then be organized by prompt (tags), displaying collections of iterations of each prompt. The intention is for users to tag their posts with their exact prompts so that image collections for each specific prompt can be generated by querying by prompt.

Instructions for using the site are as follows:
1. Sign in. 
2. Click the apple. 
3. Post an image in response to your prompt. 
4. Remember to tag your post with the exact prompt.
